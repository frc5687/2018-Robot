# Contributing

Everyone is welcome, but here are some guidelines to follow.

## Commit Messages
- use the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
- don’t capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

## Comitting to Master

If you commit code that doesn't compile or breaks the bot to master, you get push to master privileges revoked.

Best practice is to create an issue, create a branch, and open a pull request.
